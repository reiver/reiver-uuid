Now let's look a little closer at **UUID**s.

A **UUID** is 128-bits of data — do any of those bits have special meanings?
The answer is — yes.
Some bit ranges within the **128-bits** of a **UUID** have specific meanings.
For example:

	xxxxxxxx-xxxx-Mxxx-Nxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx

The 4-bits of the ``“M”`` represents the **version** of the **UUID** format that the **UUID** should be interpreted under.

And the most-significant **3-bits** of the ``“N”`` represents the **variant** of the **UUID** format that the **UUID** should be interpreted under.

So, for example, consider this **UUID**L

	            version
	              ↓
	4ffed962-adf6-4eef-931d-8d95b798c080
	                   ↑
	                variant

The **version** of this **UUID** is **UUID** **version** ``4``.

And the **variant** of this **UUID** is **UUID** **variant** ``8``.
(Why the **UUID** **variant** is `8` rather than `9` in this example will make more sense later, when we look at the **UUID** **variant** more closely.)
