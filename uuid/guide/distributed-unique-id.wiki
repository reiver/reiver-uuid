There are two main strategies for creating a **unique identifier** (**unique ID**):

• distributed, and
• centralized.

There are also some strategies that are some form of hybrid between the two.

Some examples of **unique ID**s created using a **distributed** strategy are:

• [[pseudo-random-number]]s chosen from a large-enough bit-space,
• [[chrono-random-number]]s,
• [[xim-id]]s,
• UUID of type **version**=`4` and **variant**=`10`.
