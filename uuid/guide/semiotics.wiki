If you are already aware of the jargon used in [[semiotics]] then, [[uuid]]s are **semiotic** **symbols** (once they are actually used as a identifier (**ID**) for something).

⚠️ If that (stuff about **semiotics**) doesn't mean anything to you, then just ignore it, and go to the next chapeter (after this one) and keep on reading.
